# Canvas Drawing Project ðŸŽ¨

This is a colourful interactive drawing app built using HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript. Inspired by Wes Bos's JavaScript30 challenge, it allows users to draw with dynamically changing colours and brush sizes.

## Features

- Draw on the full screen using your mouse
- Hue changes as you draw to create a rainbow effect
- Brush size increases and decreases smoothly

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

## What I learned

- Using the HTML5 Canvas API for drawing
- Working with `hsl()` colours dynamically
- Handling mouse events for drawing apps
- Implementing smooth brush size transitions
